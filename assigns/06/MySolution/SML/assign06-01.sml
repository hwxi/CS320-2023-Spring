The following is a well-known series:
ln 2 = 1 - 1/2 + 1/3 - 1/4 + ...
Please implement a stream consisting of all the partial
sums of this series.
The 1st item in the stream equals 1
The 2nd item in the stream equals 1 - 1/2
The 3rd item in the stream equals 1 - 1/2 + 1/3
The 4th item in the stream equals 1 - 1/2 + 1/3 - 1/4
And so on, and so forth
